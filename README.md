# 🩸 PANIC IS LIVE
Panic Button is — a degen one-page AI panic button experiment

> Rugpull yourself before the market does.

**PANIC** is a degen, experimental, one-page chaos panel for Solana.  
It lets an AI *maybe* trade **$1 at a time** while you hold the **panic button**.

No promises.  
No safety.  
Only control.

---

## 🔴 What is this?

- A **meme-first** AI trading experiment
- Built for **awareness**, not guarantees
- $1 max per trade
- $10 max deposit (beta)
- Auto-stop at **+65%**
- You can **panic at any time**

If something rugs — it should be **you**.

---

## 🧠 How it “works” (short version)

1. New tokens appear on Solana  
2. Bot watches volume + noise  
3. Panic level rises  
4. If panic is high → **$1 trade**
5. You smash the button and stop everything  

That’s it.

## 🚨 Panic Levels

- **Panic 0** — dead air  
- **Panic 1** — exists  
- **Panic 2** — waking up  
- **Panic 3** — tradable ($1)  
- **Panic 4** — chaos (still $1)

It’s not an AI score.  
It’s how loud the room is.

## 🧪 Status

This is **BETA**.

- Experimental
- Incomplete
- Probably dumb
- Definitely a meme

Do not treat this as financial advice.  
Do not deposit money you care about.  
Do not blame the button.

Chaos is better with witnesses.
